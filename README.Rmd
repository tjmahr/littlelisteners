# little listeners

## installation

First install the devtools package, then install the package from this repository.

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tjmahr/littlelisteners")
```


## implemented functions

Functions are being added as needed. As a first step, I've migrated
`empirical_logit` functions from [lookr](https://github.com/tjmahr/lookr).

```{r}
library("littlelisteners")
n_to_target <- c(10, 0, 1, 0)
n_to_distractor <- c(0, 1, 0, 0)

# undefined log-odds
log(n_to_target / n_to_distractor)

# add .5 trick
log((n_to_target + .5) / (n_to_distractor + .5))

# shortcut
empirical_logit(n_to_target, n_to_distractor)

# weighting function
empirical_logit_weight(n_to_target, n_to_distractor)
```
